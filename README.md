This page features an interactive grid that mimics an etch-a-sketch. It responds to the mouse as if it were a pencil, allowing the user to "fill in" cells of the grid by dragging the mouse over them. 

The grid is always 900px x 900px, and the page opens with the default 16x16 cell resolution.
There are two buttons at the top of the page. The first clears the cells so the user can begin a new drawing. The second also clears the cells, but generates a new grid based on user input of their desired row/column cell count.

This project was heavily focused on JavaScript. Besides the two buttons that were written into the HTML document, all the HTML elements (the grid and its boxes) are generated with the code in the JavaScript document.
