https://leesimonh.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

This page features an interactive grid that mimics an etch-a-sketch. It responds to the mouse as if it were a pencil, allowing the user to "fill in" cells of the grid by dragging the mouse over them. 

The grid is always 750px x 750px, and the page opens with the default 16x16 cell resolution.

This project was heavily focused on JavaScript. Most of the HTML elements (the grid and its boxes) are generated with the code in the JavaScript document.
Upon revisiting this project, I hardcoded in some more elements, like the color picker and the screen resolution slider.
